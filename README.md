# Assignment-1

I chose [WebGL Shader Examples by Javier Gracia Carpio.](https://webgl-shaders.com/) I like that it has plenty of examples that are all seperated into categories, showing the many different applications that WebGL can be used for. I like that it also shows all of the code used for each shader, and breaks the code down into seperate files which makes it easier to figure out what is going on under the hood. Many of them also use the mouse position to change the lighting/angles/positions in real time, which I found cool.
